PONGLAB by Zak Crane-Whatmore
A Michaelmas Vacation Miniproject

Take a break from your data analysis/simulation/frame2D to have a quick 
game of pong against the computer without even leaving MATLAB.

Players:
You - You control the blue paddle
Computer - The computer controls the red paddle

Controls:
Use the up arrow on your keyboard to move the paddle up
Use the down arrow on your keyboard to move the paddle down

Scoring:
Get the ball past your opponent to score but make sure the computer doesn't
get the ball past you. The first to ten points wins the game.

That's it! Just begin playing!
